Below is the license info that was originally included in the code for
the portable cache simulator available on Rodric Rabbah's webpage. This
refers to the code in cache.h

http://web.mit.edu/rabbah/www/download/cache-pintools/

The portable organic cache simulator extends that functionality. The
rest of the simulation code is totally unrelated.
