This directory is for simulator documentation.  This may include:

 - How to use the simulator
 - The internal operation of some piece of the simulator
 - How to extend or modify the simulator
 - Anything else that we want to write down and remember
    related to the operation or use of the simulator

Pin- or QEMU-implementation-specific docs should be directed to 
../pin/doc and ../qemu/doc
